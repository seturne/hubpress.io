= Where in haskell

* Using `where` after the guards and then we define several names or functions. These names are visible across the guards and give us the advantage of not having to repeat ourselves.

ghci> let bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String  
ghci> bmiTell weight height  
    | bmi <= skinny = "You're underweight, you emo, you!"  
    | bmi <= normal = "You're supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you're ugly!"  
    | bmi <= fat    = "You're fat! Lose some weight, fatty!"  
    | otherwise     = "You're a whale, congratulations!"  
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2  
          skinny = 18.5  
          normal = 25.0  
          fat = 30.0
// different way
where bmi weight / height ^ 2
      (skinny, normal, fat) = (18.5, 25.0, 30.0)
----
* Where section of a function are only visible to that function, so we don't have to worry about them polluting the namespace of other functions.
* In where block, we defined constants and functions.
