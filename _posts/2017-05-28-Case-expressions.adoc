= Case expressions

* `case` expressions are, well, expressions, much like `if else` expressions and `let` bindings.
* Form is`case expression of pattern &#8594; result ...`

[source, sh]
----
ghci> head' :: [a] -> a  h
ghci| head' xs = case xs of [] -> error "No head for empty lists!"
                            (x:_) -> x
----
* `case` expressions can be used pretty much anywhere.
+
[source, sh]
----
ghci> describeList :: [a] -> String
ghci| describeList xs = "The list is " ++ 
ghci|         case xs of [] -> "empty."
ghci|                    [x] -> "a singleton list."     
ghci|                     xs -> "a longer list."

//same way
ghci> describeList :: [a] -> String  
ghci| describeList xs = "The list is " ++ what xs  
ghci|    where what [] = "empty."  
ghci|          what [x] = "a singleton list."  
ghci|          what xs = "a longer list."

* They are useful for pattern matching against something in the middle of an expression.
